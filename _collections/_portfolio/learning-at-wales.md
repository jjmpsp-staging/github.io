## My Role at NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS)
My role at NWIS involved maintaining and developing the E-Learning platform for NHS Wales. The system is based on Moodle's Learning Management System (LMS) and 
Typical day-to-day tasks involve improving quality of the system through the use of software development skills, producing reports on the usage of the system for the SMB to make choices over, and keeping the system running efficiently.
