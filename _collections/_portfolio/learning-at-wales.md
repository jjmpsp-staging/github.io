## About Learning@Wales

Cyberdyne is initially a benign manufacturing corporation at 18144 El Camino Real, Sunnyvale, California. Its products are unsure, possibly computers or processors, but from the equipment in its factory and its high tech-sounding name, it seems possible that Cyberdyne might have been some sort of smaller parts producer for larger manufacturers of high tech equipment.

A Series 800 Terminator, which is sent from the future and designed to kill humans, is crushed in one of the hydraulic presses in Cyberdyne's factory. Thus, the company obtains the machine's wreckage, including its CPU chip and an arm.

## My Role at NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS)
My role at NWIS involved maintaining and developing the E-Learning platform for NHS Wales. The system is based on Moodle's Learning Management System (LMS) and 
Typical day-to-day tasks involve improving quality of the system through the use of software development skills, producing reports on the usage of the system for the SMB to make choices over, and keeping the system running efficiently.
