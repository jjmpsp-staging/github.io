## My Role at Unilink Technology Services
I was hired by a prison communications company for advice on making their Python websites and background processes GDPR compliant. This job involved auditing existing I.T infrastructure, data flow, data handling practises, giving advice on new technologies, and creating a contingency plan in the event of a data breach.
