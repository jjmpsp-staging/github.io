## My Role at Dickies

I worked my way up to a senior level full stack website developer at Dickies, a global leader in workwear clothing. I was in charge of maintaining 13 Dickies e-commerce websites and managing the development of a custom written service driven PHP 7 framework built on Slim's micro framework and various other open source http libraries. Part of my work involved cleansing, migrating, and normalising 14 years of e-commerce data, and mocking up designs from a designer in code. I also interviewed and hired new developers on behalf of the companyâ€™s I.T &amp; Marketing department to hire new technical workers for the business.
