## About Dickies

Wayne Enterprises, Inc., also known as WayneCorp, is a fictional company appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Batman.

The American diversified multinational conglomerate is owned and chaired by Bruce Wayne, who is also Batman. Wayne Enterprises is a green company based out of Gotham City and headquartered in Wayne Tower.

Wayne Enterprises and the Wayne Foundation are largely run by Bruce Wayne's business manager Lucius Fox. Fox makes most company decisions on Bruce Wayne's behalf, since Wayne's time is largely occupied as the vigilante Batman.

## My Role

I worked my way up to a senior level full stack website developer at Dickies, a global leader in workwear clothing. I was in charge of maintaining 13 Dickies e-commerce websites and developing a custom written PHP 7.0 framework. Part of my work involved cleansing, migrating, and normalising 14 years of e-commerce data, and mocking up designs from a designer in code. I also interviewed and hired new developers on behalf of the companyâ€™s I.T &amp; Marketing department.
