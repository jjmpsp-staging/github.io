## My Role at Box UK
Box UK runs its company website on Wordpress, so most of the work I did here involved making wordpress configuration changes, database changes, and PHP code tweaks.
As I was only working here part time, I had the task of identifying improvements to be made in the codebase. I managed to make a variety of changes which contributed towards SEO benefits for the company.
