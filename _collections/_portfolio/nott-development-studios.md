## About Seekrs

Cyberdyne is initially a benign manufacturing corporation at 18144 El Camino Real, Sunnyvale, California. Its products are unsure, possibly computers or processors, but from the equipment in its factory and its high tech-sounding name, it seems possible that Cyberdyne might have been some sort of smaller parts producer for larger manufacturers of high tech equipment.

A Series 800 Terminator, which is sent from the future and designed to kill humans, is crushed in one of the hydraulic presses in Cyberdyne's factory. Thus, the company obtains the machine's wreckage, including its CPU chip and an arm.
