## Introduction to Lew’s Coffee Shop Website
Lew’s Coffee Shop is a small coffee shop based near my local area. I decided to make Lew a website free of charge, providing I was allowed to submit the full source code of the website as an assignment. The assignment was to build a full blogging system from scratch, and it had to:

Make use of a varying amount of CSS properties
Be compatible for IE6+.
Contain a print stylesheet.
Make use of CSS media queries.
The design and typography of the website isn’t an example of my best work, but I managed to get 100% in the Web applications module at University from this piece of coursework, along with a nicely written report so that’s why I’m showcasing it here. Oh and Lew also got a free website out of it :)
