## Introduction to Cake Decorator
Cake Decorator is a Windows phone for keeping track of cake recipes and to get inspiration from user submitted cakes. I built this app for my mum to use, as her main hobby is decorating cakes.

## App description 
(what was originally submitted to Microsoft's Windows App Store)
Cake Decorator for Windows Phone is an App designed in mind for those talented cake decorators out there who own a Windows Phone.

The app features over 300 unique cake designs collected
from a wide range of websites on the internet. This can
help those who need a little more inspiration when designing cakes.

Also in the app, is a favourites manager. With the
favourites manager you can favourite your favourite cake
designs from the cake browser for later quick viewing.

The app also includes a fully functional recipe manager.
This is useful for copying out recipes of your favourite
cakes and pastries from books so they can be saved for
later viewing.
