## Introduction to Social Media Dashboard
Social Media Dashboard does exactly what it says on the tin. It is a Social Media Dashboard for managing all of your social media accounts. This project was originally a University project, but me and my good friend Jack Rimell decided to carry on working on the app in our spare time outside of University. After 3 months of development, we had quite a stable project so we decided to Kickstart this project to see if anybody else was interested in it. We want to turn our prototyped web application into a real mobile app, but unfortunately our KickStarter campaign failed so we didn’t have the funding to continue developing the app. The app is currently still used by me just over a year after developing it, so there definitely is a possibility that I may continue working on it in the future. If you’d like to read more about the project, you can visit the archived KickStarter campaign page for SocialMediaDashboard.
