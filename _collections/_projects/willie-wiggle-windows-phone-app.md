## Introduction to Willie Wiggle App
‘Willie Wiggle’ is a Windows Phone app for dancing along to the dance made famous by Willie Carson. You’ve probably already judged already for making this app, so yes I’ll admit that it’s terrible by todays standards, but back in the early days of Windows Phone, this was considered a bit of fun :) Also, this was my first ever Windows Phone app.
