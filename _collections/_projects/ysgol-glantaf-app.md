Introduction
This is a web app which I built for my school. The app tied in with the school’s online system by authenticating and scraping information from the user’s account. The app also had support for chatting to Moodle friends, but this feature was never complete due to limitations with scraping data. The app was built in the very early days of when HTML5 was introduced.

Features
Announcement system.
Timetable and current lesson information.
Registration from within the app by using a phone’s GPS (experimental).
