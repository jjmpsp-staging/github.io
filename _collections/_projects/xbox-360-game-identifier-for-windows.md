title: Xbox 360 Game Identifier (Windows GUI application)
---

## Introduction
Xbox 360 Game Identifier was a Windows Program written in .NET for accessing the file storage of your Xbox 360 Hard Drive. It helped identify which game was which by reading and parsing valid Xbox 360 game container files. Once a hard drive had been loaded, you were given the option to update (or restore) game update files. This was a process that could take many hours to do on the Xbox 360 itself, so this program simplified that task and brought hours of time down to minutes. The application itself was made up of a database of games, which tied in with a forum full of user submitted game updates.
