## Introduction to Loner.me Social Network
loner.me was a social network written from scratch in PHP, Node, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I once told a friend that it would be interesting to see if I could create a social networking website from scratch with my current web development knowledge. He had a bet that I couldn’t so I spent 3 months creating one and this is the result.

Looking back at the website now, it’s pretty damn ugly because it lacks quite a bit of styling, but I still like it. I am quite glad that I managed to create this website because it helped me learn so much more about website development and server management. The website was live for sometime and I managed to get around 100 active users using the chatroom feature because they thought it was pretty cool. When the domain expired I decided that I didn’t want to continue working on this website, so I closed it down.
