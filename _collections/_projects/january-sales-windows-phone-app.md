Introduction
January Sales is a Windows phone app for calculating the prices of products inclusive of their sale value.

App description (what was originally submitted to the app store)
With the upcoming sales happening, we all want to grab a bargain. However, working out percentage off calculations in your head can sometimes be a pain.

With this simple to use app, you can get an instant calculation of how much an item will cost during a sale. All you have to do is simply input the price of the item, and slide the percentage bar to the value of the sale percentage.

The app currently supports the Great British Pound (GBP) currency (£), the Dollar currency ($), and the Euro currency (€).

Please leave a review if you would like any features added to this application in the future.

Thanks for choosing ‘January Sales’ .
