title: UniSaver (funded by Jisc)

## Introduction to UniSaver
UniSaver is an online money saving community for students. This was a project which I proposed to the Jisc Summer of Student Innovation website and successfully gained funding to continue working on the project. The website was written in the CodeIngiter framework and was built on a fully featured API backend.

UniSaver was listed on various startup and entrepreneur websites, but sadly never got finished due to being such a time consuming project.

## Features of UniSaver
Complete money saving community for sharing, rating, and claiming deals.
