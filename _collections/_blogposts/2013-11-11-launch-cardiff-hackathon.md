<p>Back in October 2013, I took part in an event called Launch48 with my good friends <a href="http://sidengo.com/mrhysjones">Matthew Jones</a>,&nbsp;Nathan Ahmad<a id="js_28" href="https://www.facebook.com/nathan.ahmad" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=545126489"></a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://luke-berry.co.uk/">Luke Berry</a>.</p>
<p>The aim of the event was simple: Work with strangers that you’ve never met before for 48 hours straight to build a startup that’s going to make millions (umm yeah).</p>

<!--more-->

<p>As stressful as the event may sound, it was actually pretty fun.&nbsp;Although the actual time working on stuff was probably about 20 hours when we included going home and eating within the time that we had – this made it even more of a manic weekend.</p>
<p>The idea that I worked on was called WannaBeASpaceman? and was pitched by&nbsp;<a href="http://amieduggan.com/">Amie</a>.</p>
<p>To sum up&nbsp;WannaBeASpaceman in a short sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>WannaBeASpaceman is a&nbsp;library of short videos for children who need help to answer the question: "What do you want to be when you grow up?"</p></blockquote>
<p>After many beers, waters and slices of pizza we came up with a working prototype, a business plan, as well as a pitch&nbsp;of what WannaBeASpaceman was going to be (all in under 48 hours!)</p>
<p>You can see our final result <a href="http://beaspaceman.herokuapp.com/">here</a>&nbsp;which is kindly hosted by <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately WannaBeASpaceMan didn’t take off (no pun intended) beyond the Launch48 event&nbsp;to make us all millionaires, but it was still a great weekend.</p>

Wanna be a Spaceman was born out of an original blog post 'No-one ever told me I could be a spaceman' - after a lifetime of poor career guidance she vowed to create a curated library of professionally produced videos which would give a realistic insight into a variety of industries.
The opportunity to turn an idea into reality didn't present itself until an event in October 2013. Launch 48 (www.launch48.com/cardiffweekend) brought together an eclectic mix of folk from various industries including web development, marketing, business and education.
Over a period of 48 hours, hardly any sleep and a lot of coffee, a team of nine people filmed a load of great people talking about their jobs, built an extensive backend database which allowed people to search the site, designed a beautiful website and got a social media presence.
The result was a social enterprise called 'Wanna be a Spaceman' - the principle behind the site is not to try and solve every problem that exists in the world of careers advice, but rather to do one thing well. Beautiful, simple & inspiring videos which will help to inspire, direct and give choice to anyone who needs some careers guidance.
