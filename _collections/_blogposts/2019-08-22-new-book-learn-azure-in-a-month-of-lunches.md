I'm excited to announce I've added a new book to my reading list today: [Learn Azure in a Month of Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-azure-in-a-month-of-lunches).

I've been using Azure for years now, but never really got into the nitty gritty of the platform and hope this book can help demystify some of the unknowns I have about the Cloud platform Azure provides. Since I decided I'm going to specialise in becoming an expert with the Azure platform, learning the ins-and-outs of the book is my goal.

Here are some open reviews about the book:
> Microsoft recommends this book as a high-quality resource for learning Microsoft Azure.

> You don't need to learn everything about Azure to do some incredible stuff. Learn Azure in a Month of Lunches gets you started by breaking down the most important concepts and tasks into 21 bite-sized lessons, complete with examples, exercises, and labs. You'll be productive immediately, and when you finish you'll be well on the way to Azure mastery!
 
If you're interested in checking out the book - Learn Azure in a Month of Lunches then you buy it on Amazon.

Cost is something I've always been concerned about with cloud services
