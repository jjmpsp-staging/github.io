I'm excited to announce that I've added a new book to my reading list today: [Learn Azure in a Month of Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-azure-in-a-month-of-lunches).

I've been using Azure for years now, but never really got into the nitty gritty of the platform and hope this book can help demystify some of the unknowns I have about the Cloud platform Azure provides. Since I decided I'm going to specialise in becoming an expert with the Azure platform, learning the ins-and-outs of the book is my goal.

=======
I've been using Azure for a few years now, but never really got into the nitty gritty of the platform on what's actually possible on a larger scale. It seems that now is the perfect time to get onboard with learning Azure, due to the wealth of new features coming each week (yes - week!) So yes, the book is actually out of date already, although this is the case with most modern tech books these days and doesn't make this title any less reason to pickup and read. 

This year (2019), Microsoft changed the structure of their certification programme, meaning you now only need to complete one exam to be an 'Associate' for the Azure technology. If you take and pass the AZ-103 then you officially become an MCA (Microsoft Certified Associate) and ready for basic jobs in the field. Of course this course is in no means a beginner course and getting started with the Azure Fundamentals course is highly recommended if you're completely new to the platform. 

Since I decided I'm going to specialise in becoming an expert with the Azure platform,
 
 as I see lots of potential for it in the future.
Cost is something I've always been concerned about with cloud services but I'm hoping this book can teach me new ways of managing costs on the Azure platform seen as I know Microsoft are trying harder each day to push more smaller companies towards the Cloud. 

What's more interesting to me about this book is that it includes source code along with each of the chapters. It seems you are free to explore this source code as it has been open sourced on Github, meaning you don't actually need to buy the book if you just want to make use of the free ARM (Azure Resource Manager) templates provided by the author. 

Here are some open reviews about the book:
> Microsoft recommends this book as a high-quality resource for learning Microsoft Azure.

> You don't need to learn everything about Azure to do some incredible stuff. Learn Azure in a Month of Lunches gets you started by breaking down the most important concepts and tasks into 21 bite-sized lessons, complete with examples, exercises, and labs. You'll be productive immediately, and when you finish you'll be well on the way to Azure mastery!
 
If you're interested in checking out the book - Learn Azure in a Month of Lunches then you buy it on Amazon.
