1. It's small enough to walk pretty much anywhere you need to go.

2. It's not quite London, but it's not far from it.
Don't get me wrong, I love visiting London but one problem I have with it is how unhappy and rude can be. Everyone is in so much of a damn rush and they'll give you the filthiest look ever just for stepping in their way by mistake. Thankfully, Cardiff isn't quite as busy as London but has a similar vibe. There's a lot going on during the entire year, and people are generally friendlier here than London.

3. The bars and pubs make it one of the best places to drink in the world

4. It has one of the biggest University cultures in the country.
Cardiff contains multiple University campuses and this makes it a popular choice amongst students to decide to come and study here.

5. It has some of the loveliest parks

6. You can cycle pretty much anywhere.
Cardiff is relatively flat, meaning cycling around is somewhat easier than other UK cities. The local council is also doing a lot of work to try promote cycling in the City and reduce the amount of cars on the road.

8. There's plenty of sports events here.
The Millenium stadium was build in 1999 and is one of the only stadiums in the world with a retractable roof and a capacity of over 70,000. It's an impressive stadium and has hosted popular events such as Monster Jam: UK, and Ed Sheeran tours.

9. The city has great transport links to any other part of the UK (and a relatively small airport)
Cardiff Bus operates a number of routes across all parts of the City and surrounding areas. Unfortunately, some areas are preferred than others 
I'll be completely honest in saying it's somewhat sad to see the wasted potential that Cardiff airport could offer, but even still there are now more connections offered than ever before with Qatar Airways now offering daily flight connections to Doha.
There are also trains available which operate between 
Want to travel elsewhere? We also have a temporary. As of 2019 there are no plans to continue developing this new bus station, so for now we'll just have to deal with walking to Sophia Gardens bus station to catch coaches operated by National Express and MegaBus.

10. Cardiff's diversity is becoming more wide spread and there are now people here from all over the world.
Scared you won't fit in here? I bet you will.
