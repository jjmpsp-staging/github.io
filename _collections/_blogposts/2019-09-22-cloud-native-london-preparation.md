It's 1pm on a Sunday afternoon and raining in Cardiff today. Yesterday was an incredible day as far as weather in September goes but now it really does feel like winter is approaching.
what a great opportunity to write a blog update on life events and get some development work done! It's the week of Cloud Native London this week so I'm going to discuss what I've got planned for the week.

Last night I went for a casual 'few bevvies' with friends but then ended up meeting up with some old friends from University.

    I have a keen interest in cloud, automation, scaling, dev-ops practises, open source, etc. in addition to the software development practises I use at work and feel like it’s important to stay on top of developments in the industry. I find one of the best ways of exploring new technologies is to attend events to learn how different organisations are implementing and measuring the success of different systems & methodologies. Two of the best conferences worldwide for discovering the latest web tech trends are Cloud Native London, and Web Summit. Getting tickets for either of these events is pretty tricky and I’ve applied for them on previous years without success. However, I’m very happy to say that I’ve managed to buy tickets for both of these conferences this year!
