There's no doubt about it that the I.T field is a great field to work in. The masses of knowledge you gain from working in different companies mean your skills actually become transferrable to a whole lot of other industries too.

One of the most simple way to demonstrate what a smart home is to non-techies is to show them you switching your bedroom light on by using your voice.

But in all honesty, what's the actual point of this?

Computers can automate a whole lot of tasks for us, but how far should we go before our jobs are actually at risk because there are millions of computers in the world doing the jobs us humans used to do?

Want to go outside and water the plants? Nah, no need to do that anymore as the automated sprinkler system will turn on soon.

Emptying the rubbish (or trash for you US readers)


Remember being a young child and you'd try your absolute best to earn money by doing small errands around the house for an allowance.

In a real life scenario we have objects that we humans wan to interact with, but by making all of these devices 'smart' by connecting them to the internet, we're actually making ourselves even lasier.

Young people need to go outside.

People need jobs.

Sanity comes at a cost.
