## Home after a busy few days at Cloud Native London!

If you haven't spotted my previous blog post already: [(Cloud Native London Preparations)](/blogposts/2019-09-22-cloud-native-london-preparation.html), then be sure to read it now as this post is a follow-up post to that post.

Last week I took a visit to London to attend a tech conference called [Cloud Native London 2019](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/11723-cloudnative-london-2019) to learn more about the state of Cloud Native Development; Including the tools that are being developed by the community and how different organisations are implementing such tools into their work flows.

As you can see from the below image, I've got an absurd amount of notes which I noted down during my time watching tracks and keynotes from speakers.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/img/posts/cloud-native-london/notes.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="border-radius: 25px;margin: 0 20px 10px 0;">

In this post I've summarised these notes as part of a joint effort to digitise them and to share knowledge with others.

All of the keynotes were recorded and are watchable on the [SkillsMatter website](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/) for as long as the site exists. I would embed each recording here but it appears these videos are hidden behind a login so I won't share them just in case this is against the SkillsMatter terms of use.

I've included the Twitter handles of each speaker, because y'know, all good speakers use Twitter - Maybe I need to get back into using Twitter? If not, I've included the personal website of the speaker.

Start of Cloud Native London 2019:
