## A little bit about Jekyll
Jekyll is powered by a subset language called Liquid. If you've ever done any Shopify development, or Mailchimp newsletter development in the past then you may be aware of what the liquid templating language is.
To keep things simple, Liquid allows you to perform operations on . 'piped through' to other functions.
