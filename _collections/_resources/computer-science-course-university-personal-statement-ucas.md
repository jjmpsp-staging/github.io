This is the personal statement that I sent along with my UCAS application to get into University.

If you’re looking for an example / sample personal statement for a computer science course application at University, feel free to use mine as an example. I don’t care about plagiarism or anything like that ;D


Personal statement

“Three apples have changed the world: Adam’s, Newton’s and Steve’s.”

Since I got an Xbox 360 at the age of 12, and my first laptop computer at the age of 14, I have always been a tech fanatic.

Sometime back in 2007, I was playing on my xbox 360 when all of a sudden the console decided to die on me and display the red rings of death. I decided to research the red ring problem further until one day I managed to fix the console. The problem suddenly became well known to other consoles and started happening to my friends consoles too, so they asked me to fix theirs. A year later I had opened up and fixed almost fifty consoles for friends and family.

From my experience of learning about the Xbox 360 hardware, I decided to take CISCO as part of one of my GCSE subjects in school. Cisco is still one of my subjects to this day after 4 whole school years of learning about computer hardware and networking. Thanks to Cisco, I have a much better idea of how computers work and communicate. I have also learnt basic office skills from creating pamphlets, PowerPoint’s and booklets.

Back in 2009, I discovered the world of programming for the first time and decided to teach myself basic programming in VB.NET. Since then, I have taught myself 8 programming languages in total, which include:
PHP, HTML, CSS, MYSQL + Database query languages, C#, C++ , Javascript / The jQuery framework. During my time learning these programming languages I have coded many applications and started many personal projects. If you’d like to see any of my projects in detail, I have setup my own website where most of my newest projects are posted. You can visit my website by going to: http://www.joel-murphy.com .

At the start of my AS levels I gained a keen interest in Engineering as i’m the type of person that likes to know how things work. I took part in a scheme called Engineering Eduction Scheme Wales (EESW), made several new friends in school and gained a strong relationship with them outside of school too. Due to our strong co-operative teamwork and thinking skills, the project was a success and so our team was invited to the Celtic Manor in Newport to present the solution to our brief to many engineers across the country. Each member of our team was awarded a ‘Gold Quest Award’ from the BBC for finding a solution to their problem.

During my AS Levels I also learnt a great deal of skills from taking Leisure as a subject. The whole course was to do with dealing with customers, customer service skills, and management. Doing this subject has made me a much more professional individual and ten times more confident than I used to be.

Every week I do 2-3 hours of voluntary work for a charity called Hybu Pobl Ifanc. All money raised from this charity goes to the BBC’s Children In Need event. From working at Hybu, I have gained strong social and trust skills from working with people and dealing with money.

Recently, I have gained a strong interest in business related things. During the summer holidays of 2011, myself and a close friend setup a business called ‘Eco Cardiff’. The whole business was setup, marketed, as well as managed by the both of us. By the end of the Summer we worked on over 30 gardens for family and friends. We will hopefully continue with this business next Summer.

Towards the end of the Summer holidays of 2011, I took part in an event called Young Rewired State. This was one of the best achievements of my life, as I won a prize for creating an app for the Food Standards Agency. I won the prize title for ‘Best use of government data’ and the app was mentioned by many websites, blog writers, as well as featured in the Guardian. My school website even decided to post the news up so other people were aware of my work.

At the time of writing this, I have been asked by someone from the government if i’d like to develop the app further into an IOS and Android app, further details of that will be posted on my website.

The best part of computer science in my opinion is actually developing software.
It may sound strange, but I actually enjoy solving problems with code, even if they do leave me frustrated sometimes. The buzz I get when I solve computer problems is somewhat satisfying.

Doing a degree in computer science would hopefully give me an even better understanding of computer systems and get me ready for having a job in the computing industry when I’m older. One day I’d love to be part of something big, or become an internet entrepreneur.
