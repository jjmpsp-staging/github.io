title: How to get started with software development
---



Many people I speak to say they're really interested in getting started with writing software, but have no actual clue where to get started.

In this tutorial I will discuss some of the programming languages out there and how they have developed over time.


## Figure out what you actually want to build before you start
What's your end goal?
Ask yourself what you want to create and why.

For example; I want to create an app that will allow me to input my weight 

Right down what you want the app to do and why.

Who? What? Why? When? Where?

Part of my work as a systems analyst involves looking at complex systems and asking these questions.

Even those who are more advanced in their field can sometimes 'jump the gun' and get carried away with wanting to dive into code.

In some future tutorials I will discuss some advanced topics such as how to engineer an app by following best practises, how to automate a lot of the boring tasks



Will your app be for fun? Does it solve a task?
Once you've built your first simple app, you've opened yourself to a whole lot of other opportunities in the I.T world. 

What happens when users generate data. We call this Big Data.
What happens when 

Feeling your brain fry yet? Yeah it happens. But don't worry, we can help simplify our processes by building on our work. Why let us do a bunch of processes if a computer can do it for us?
