Welcome to the personal website of Joel Murphy. You've probably stumbled across this page because I've directed you here or you've been stalking my online profiles (hey, everyone does it and I don't actually mind as I've put this information on the internet in the first place!)

I am a Level 3 Cisco Certified technician and hold a technical 2nd class Degree from Cardiff University in Computer Science with Informatics & Business Information Systems. My A-Level qualifications consist of; Design, Technology & Product Development (D.T), Computing, and Leisure & Management Studies.

I am passionate about developing innovative I.T solutions and delivering them to clients, or businesses in an exceptional standard. Over the past decade, I’ve learned to become a team leader, in addition to an expert software developer from running my own digital businesses and working in multiple companies & environments.

I’ve worked for small start-up companies, as well as corporations in contracted and employed positions. Due to this, my skills are flexible and tie into many different I.T positions - especially those involving Software Development, or Project Management skills. I am able to fit into existing roles with my skills, or train on the job to acquire skills specific to a business’s needs.
