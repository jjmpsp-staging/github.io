Welcome to the personal website of Joel Murphy. You've probably stumbled across this website because I've directed you here to learn from my [tutorials](/tutorials), or you've been stalking one of my online social media profiles and you've ended clicking through to here (hey, it's okay - we're all human and get curious sometimes!)

I've created this website as a central repository of information to document things I find interesting in my personal and work life. You'll find that the majority of the content here is about technology, this is because it's the industry I work in. The spirit of sharing is important. I believe anyone can learn anything if they put their mind to it, so I'll be sharing my learning experiences,  


If you're here to learn about technology related topics, you may be interested in some of my tutorials, my talks, or my blog posts. I try to update these as often as possible whenever I have some free time.

I'll be using emoji's throughout the website because they add nice personal touch to the content I write and make things more interesting.

Otherwise, have a nice day (or night), whatever part of the world you're from. 

I am a Level 3 Cisco Certified technician and hold a technical 2nd class Degree from Cardiff University in Computer Science with Informatics & Business Information Systems. My A-Level qualifications consist of; Design, Technology & Product Development (D.T), Computing, and Leisure & Management Studies.

I am passionate about developing innovative I.T solutions and delivering them to clients, or organisations in an exceptional standard. Over the past decade, I’ve learned to become a team leader, in addition to an expert software developer from running my own digital businesses and working in multiple companies & environments.

I’ve worked for small start-up companies, as well as corporations in contracted and employed positions. Due to this, my skills are flexible and tie into many different I.T positions - especially those involving Software Development, or Project Management skills. I am able to fit into existing roles with my skills, or train on the job to acquire skills specific to a business’s needs.
