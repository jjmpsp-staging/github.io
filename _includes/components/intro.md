Welcome to the personal website of Joel Murphy. You've probably stumbled across this website because I've directed you here to learn from my [tutorials](/tutorials), or otherwise you might have been stalking my social media profiles and you've ended up clicking through to here (hey, it's okay - we're all human and get curious sometimes! ðŸ˜‚)

I've created this website as a central repository of information to document topics, events, and developments I find interesting in my personal and work life. You'll find that the majority of the content shared here is about technology, this is because it's the industry I work in. I also post about [my travels](/travel), [product reviews](product reviews), and [money saving tips ](/money-saving-tips) too - so maybe you non tech enthusiasts who visit this website may interested in checking out those instead.  

If you're here to learn about technology related topics, you may be interested in some of [my tutorials](), [my talks](), or [my blog posts](). I try to update these as often as possible whenever I have some free time. I'll be using emoji's throughout the website because they add a nice personal touch to the content I write and make things a little more interesting compared to staring at a screen of bland text. ðŸ‘Œ

All of the content published on this website will be in English. If the content I produce gains some popularity, I'd be more than happy to give permission for it to be translated into another language. However, please notify me of any planned publications you hope to make ahead of time, as it would be appreciated to get some credit in the form of a link back to the original source for basing your work off of mine .

That's all for now. I hope you have a fantastic day (or night), depending on which part of the world you are from. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me by clicking on the contact button located in the side bar of this website. 








I am a Level 3 Cisco Certified technician and hold a technical 2nd class Degree from Cardiff University in Computer Science with Informatics & Business Information Systems. My A-Level qualifications consist of; Design, Technology & Product Development (D.T), Computing, and Leisure & Management Studies.

I am passionate about developing innovative I.T solutions and delivering them to clients, or organisations in an exceptional standard. Over the past decade, Iâ€™ve learned to become a team leader, in addition to an expert software developer from running my own digital businesses and working in multiple companies & environments.

Iâ€™ve worked for small start-up companies, as well as corporations in contracted and employed positions. Due to this, my skills are flexible and tie into many different I.T positions - especially those involving Software Development, or Project Management skills. I am able to fit into existing roles with my skills, or train on the job to acquire skills specific to a businessâ€™s needs.
